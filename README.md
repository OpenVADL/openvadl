**OpenVADL** is an open-source implementation of **VADL**, a processor description language.
VADL enables users to specify both instruction set architectures (ISA) and microarchitectures in a modern, intuitive
way.
For details, see the [official documentation](https://openvadl.github.io/openvadl/).

OpenVADL can generate multiple artifacts from a single VADL specification:

- **Instruction Set Simulator** via a custom QEMU frontend
- **Compiler** via a custom LLVM backend
- **Linker and Assembler** by integrating a generated parser into LLVM

Additional tools, such as a **Chisel** generator for hardware synthesis, are in development.

Check out our [VADL-related publications](https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/vadl/pubs) for more background.

## Getting Started

If you want to use OpenVADL, please refer to [the documentation](https://openvadl.github.io/openvadl/).
It covers everything you need to install OpenVADL, write a specification, and use the CLI to generate artifacts like a
simulator or compiler.

For working VADL specifications examples, check out
our [reference specifications](https://github.com/OpenVADL/openvadl/tree/master/vadl/test/resources/testSource/sys).  
These are tested and kept up to date with the current OpenVADL version.

## Contribution

If OpenVADL sounds like an interesting project and you'd like to collaborate or contribute, please reach out!

There are plenty of open tasks, including:

- A cycle-approximate simulator generator
- User-mode emulation in the generated ISS
- A documentation engine for embedding architecture specs directly in VADL
- Improvements to the QEMU-based ISS
- Enhancements to the LLVM-based compiler

There are also many potential Bachelor and Master thesis topics available.

## Q&A and Bugs

If you have any questions, please use
our [discussion panel](https://github.com/OpenVADL/openvadl/discussions/categories/q-a).  
This helps others with similar issues find answers more easily.

If you encounter a crash or incorrect behavior, please report it as
an [issue](https://github.com/OpenVADL/openvadl/issues).  
Before creating a new issue, check if one already exists for the same problem.

# Development

Before contributing, please read [OpenVADL's contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Project Structure

The `open-vadl` project includes multiple Gradle modules.

- `vadl` is the main module that contains all the logic of OpenVADL
- `vadl-cli` implements the CLI for OpenVADL users. It uses the `vadl` module as a library
- `java-annotations` provides Java (!) annotations (e.g. `@Input`) that are used in the VIAM.
  Additionally it provides `errorprone` bug detectors, that statically check if certain properties
  in the VIAM are correctly implemented.

## Getting Started

You need a working JDK 21 (or higher) installation on your `PATH` to build OpenVADL.
To directly build and run OpenVADL without installing it, use the `./gradlew run --args="<args>"` command.

For example, you can create the ISS (Instruction Set Simulator) for a minimal risc-v example with:

```bash
./gradlew run --args="iss sys/risc-v/rv64im.vadl"
```

To get a description of the complete usage, you can run: `./gradlew run --args="--help"`

### Building

You can build and run in two steps with

```bash
./gradlew installDist
```

Which will create an executable script at: `vadl-cli/build/install/openvadl/bin/openvadl`.

To build a [GraalVM Native Image](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/) you first need to set
`$JAVA_HOME` to point to your GraalVM installation.
With that you can run:

```bash
./gradlew nativeCompile
```

Which will create an executable at: `vadl-cli/build/native/nativeCompile/openvadl`

### Run all tests

To run all tests you need to have docker running on your system.

```bash
./gradlew test
```

**Note:** The tests are quite resource intensive (especially on memory and disk space) so make sure docker has enough
available, otherwise the tests might fail.

Expect the tests to run a long time (up to an hour isn't unrealistic).

## Checkstyle

We are using Checkstyle to ensure a consistent format and documentation of the source code.

Install the Checkstyle plugin for your IDE and import our Checkstyle configuration.
The configuration is located under `config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`.

To locally test if the checkstyle CI pipeline would fail, run the `checkstyleAll` gradle task.

### Using Intellij

To use the Checkstyle confirm IntelliJ code style follow these steps:

1. Go to `Settings > Editor > Code Style > Java`
2. For the `Scheme` select `Project`

If you still get formatting conflicts between Intellij and Checkstyle follow these steps:

1. Go to
   `Settings > Editor > Code Style > Java`
2. Click on the settings icon and select `Import Scheme > Checkstyle configuration`
3. Choose the Checkstyle config file under `config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`
4. Enable the Java code style setting `JavaDocs > Other > Indent continuation lines`
   This prevents a JavaDocs formatting conflict between IntelliJ and Checkstyle.

With this, IntelliJ uses the code style rules as specified in the Checkstyle config.
Note that Checkstyle and code style are not 100% compatible,
so IntelliJ will eventually generate some invalid formatted code (such as Java docs
paragraph separation).
