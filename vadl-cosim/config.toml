#		  This is the most thorough but also slowest option.
#
# NOTE: the following is not yet implemented.
# "tb":   The execution-step is the *execution of a single or multiple translation-blocks*.
#		  Multiple translation-blocks might be executed in a single step if another client executed a larger.
#		  (but potentially equivalent to multiple smaller TBs) translation-block.
#		  This allows instruction-equivalent clients to "synchronize" even if the generated translation-blocks differ.
#		  This option is faster than "insn" but less thorough.
#
# "tb-strict": The execution-step is the *execution of a single translation-blocks*.
#			   The same as "tb" but without the synchronization logic. Meaning that equal translation-blocks are assumed.
#			   This option is useful if the instructions of the ISS are already correct and the TB-Block generator needs to be tested.
