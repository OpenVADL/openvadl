/**
 * The Counter represents a program in a VADL specification.
 *
 * <p>There are 3 ways to define a program counter (same for group counters) in VADL:
 * <pre>
 *   1. program counter PC: Bits<32>
 *   2. alias program counter PC: Bits<32> = ONE_DIM_REGISTER
 *   3. alias program counter PC: Bits<32> = MULTI_DIM_REGISTER( < constant >, ... )
 * </pre>
 * This means the program counter refers to some entry in a register.
 * The concrete dimension and entry is given by the {@link #indices()}, which
 * provides a constant for each dimension that is accessed to reference the program counter.</p>
 *
 * <p>Currently, generators only support one-dimensional program counters, e.i.,
 * with an empty {@link #indices()} list.</p>
 *
 * <p>In a VADL specification a program counter may be annotated with a position annotation
 * ({@code CURRENT, NEXT, NEXT NEXT}).
 * However, in the VIAM, the program counter always points to the current instruction.
 * The logic required to adjust the program counter in case of a position other than
 * {@code CURRENT}, is handled and inserted in the frontend.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> The register tensor definition is not owned by the counter but
 * only referenced by it.</p>
