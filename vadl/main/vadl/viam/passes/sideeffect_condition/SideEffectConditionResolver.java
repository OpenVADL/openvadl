  /*
  The recursive resolveBranch method traverses the branch and for each side effect it
  sets the condition that must be true to be in the current branch.

  The method only calls itself in case of a control split, where a new sub-branch must be
  entered.
  Otherwise, there is always a well-defined successor that can be set as the next `current`.
  So we loop through the control nodes, until one of two things happens

    1.  We found an AbstractEndNode, which that we reached the end of the branch.
        We iterate through the set of side effects in hold by the end node.
        If the side effect node already has a condition (this might be the case as the side effect
        is a unique node), we create a condition by ORing the existing condition and the given
        branch condition.
        If there is no such condition yet, we simply set the condition to the branch condition.
        Then we find the MergeNode that uses the end node and return, so the loop is exited.

     2. We found a ControlSplitNode, which currently can only be an IfNode.
        As there is an if node, we have to resolve the side effects in both branches.
        So we call resolveBranch on the trueBranch, while the branch condition is the ANDing of
        the current branch condition and the if condition.
        We do the same for the falseBranch, but NOT the if condition before ANDing it with the
        current branch condition.

        We get the MergeNode from both sub branches, and ensure that they are equal.
        As we haven't reached the end of the current branch yet, we set `current` to the
        retrieved MergeNode and continue in the loop.
